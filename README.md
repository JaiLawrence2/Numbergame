# Numbergame
This was one of my assignments in my Java class that was used to help us understand the topics that we had been covering in class. In this program, the user tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then it asks the user to guess the number and it outputs whether the number that as selected was too low or too high. I utilized several if-then-else statemens to check if the input from the user was within the 1 to 100 range. Once the user guessed the secret number, the computer output a congratulatory message including the number of attempts it took them to guess the number.
